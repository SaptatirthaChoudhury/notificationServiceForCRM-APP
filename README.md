# Hi! I am notificationService to notify you via email :-

## So this service is made for CRM App. In CRM App there is component called ticket which can be created by a reporter. A reporter could be customer or engineer but in most of the times customer create the ticket and the ticket would be assigned to engineer to handle the ticket. Whenever the ticket will be created by customer and assigned to engineer a notification service sends email to customer and engineer to acknowledge the customer that ticket has been created successfully and ticket has been assigned to engineer successfully. And via email customer also get trackingId from the server in order to check ticket status.
